//First, we'll make a basic named function
//we can call functions before they're declared due to something called HOISTING
helloWorld();

function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hi World :)");
}

//anon(13) //<- Anonymous functions are NOT HOISTED! So we can't invoke them before declaration

//Here's an anonymous function - it has no name, but we can assign them to variables
anon = function (var1) {
  console.log("Hi I'm an anonymous function stored in a variable!");
  console.log("My variable value is: " + var1);

arrowFunc(0, false); // 0 and false are both falsy, but different datatypes
arrowFunc(2, true);

//Callback functions - functions that get passed as params to other functions

console.log("==============================(Global Scope)");

//anything that is globally scoped can be accessed anywhere in the script (the JS file)
console.log(a); //this is visible... but it's "undefined"

//vars are globally scoped due to HOISTING - all named functions and vars are hoisted and globally scoped
var a = 5;

console.log(a); //a is visible with a value after declaration of course

//Let's attempt the same thing with a let---------
//console.log(b) <- This is ILLEGAL! lets and consts are NOT hoisted

//This is actually a good thing - we usually don't want access to undefined variables

let b = 10;

console.log(b); //and of course, this prints just fine

console.log(
  "==============================(Local Scope - Block scope vs Function scope)"
);

//block scope----------/

//any variable inside a {BLOCK} that ISN'T a function is "block scoped"
if (true) {
  var c = "I'm a var in a block - I'm block scoped";
  let d = "I'm a let in a block - I'm block scoped";
}

console.log(c); //vars are globally scoped, so they're visible outside of any block they were defined in
//console.log(d) //lets and consts are NOT visible outside of any block they were defined in

//function scope------------/

//any variable defined in a function is function scoped
function scopeTest() {
  var e = "I am a var in a function - I'm function scoped";
}

console.log(e);

/* The main difference between block and function scope -

-vars are not visible outside the function they're declared in
-BUT... vars ARE visible outside of any non-function block they're declared in

-lets and consts are only visible within their block, period

Since we only really use let and const these days, we don't have to worry as much about weird var behavior

also, functions behave similar to vars, they tend to be globally scoped and hoisted. 
But I like that behavior for functions */
